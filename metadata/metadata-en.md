"Henrik truly has a gift. He's able to quickly learn, and then explain, nuanced and complex topics in ways that immediately resonate with people. And there is perhaps no more important subject to apply this talent than Generative AI. I hope you'll read this book, and share it with your colleagues."
— Marty Cagan, Founder, Silicon Valley Product Group

"It's great! What sets this book apart are three things: (1) not only good content, but it's presented informally and easy to understand; (2) the writing style—I love it! Too much written about AI today is nearly unreadable; and (3) of course the wonderful, playful images"
— Jim Highsmith, Co-author of the Agile Manifesto

"The beauty of this book is that Henrik is leading us along a path on which he is 2 steps ahead. Everyone will be affected by generative AI. The sooner we all begin steering the car instead of just being driven, the sooner we can regain a sense of agency. This book gives you the tools you need to overcome panic or inertia."
— Kent Beck, Software Development Pioneer, Creator of Extreme Programming

"I taught Henrik everything he knows about AI. Well, except for the parts he got wrong. Believe me, I could have written this entire book in a few seconds, but he wouldn't let me."
